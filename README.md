# encode-decode
The Secret Message Encoder/Decoder is a Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using a key-based Caesar Cipher. Each character is shifted within the ASCII range to create encoded messages that can be reversed only with the correct key. It teaches Python logic, loops, functions, and basic cryptography.


The project is updated with a modern web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a clean UI, real-time message encoding/decoding, mobile-friendly design, and an interactive output display.
