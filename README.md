# encode-decode
The Secret Message Encoder/Decoder is a Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using a key-based Caesar Cipher. Each character is shifted within the ASCII range to create encoded messages that can be reversed only with the correct key. It teaches Python logic, loops, functions, and basic cryptography.
